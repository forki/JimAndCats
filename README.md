#Jim and Cats

A bunch of F# microservices with a web API.

If this was a real thing with lots of developers they would be in separate Visual Studio solutions, but as a personal project it's easier to just keep them all together.

###The services are:

####Jim: Just Identity Management.

Manages user authentication details and basic identity info (i.e. people's full name).

####Cats: Crowdfunding Ask Templates.

Manages a collection of projects asking for crowdfunding.

####Cats.ReadModelUpdater:

####Pledges:

Allows people to make pledges to cats

###There are also some shared libraries:

####MicroCQRS.Common

Some generic code for making F# microservices backed by EventStore and fronted by a Suave web server

####Suave.Extensions

Some handy utilities for making Suave web services

####MicroCQRS.Common.Testing

Some utilities for testing Suave/EventStore microservices

###Other:
Almost all the projects have an associated unit test project. These do not require access to a real EventStore instance, and run any required web server in-process.

There is also a separate solution called IntegrationTests in its own folder, containing tests which start the services in separate processes and interact with them soley via REST. These tests verify that the different services are successfully coordinated via EventStore.
