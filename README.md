#Jim and Cats

A bunch of F# microservices with a web API.

They would be in separate Visual Studio solutions if this was a real thing with lots of developers, but as a one person personal project it's easier to just keep them all together.

###The services are:

Jim: Just Identity Management. Manages authentication and basic user details.

Cats: Crowdfunding Ask Templates. Manages a collection of projects asking for crowdfunding.

Pledge: Allows people to make pledges to cats
