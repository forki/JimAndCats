#Jim and Cats

A bunch of F# microservices with a web API.

If this was a real thing with lots of developers they would be in separate Visual Studio solutions, but as a personal project it's easier to just keep them all together.

###The services are:

####Jim.CommandHandler: Just Identity Management Command Handler

* Manages commands relating to user authentication details and basic identity info (i.e. people's full name).

* Commands result in events being written to a private stream in an Event Store cluster. An Event Store projection takes the private identity events resulting from commands and maps them to new events on a public stream (omitting all data and events relating to password hashes).

* The command processor currently checks the legality of commands using and in-memory read model of all user aggregates. I will change this to use a SQL Server database at some point.

* Commands are intentionally synchronous (via an F# MailboxProcessor) to avoid the creation of conflicting users via concurrent events (e.g. two users with the same email address). Because of this the service is not currently horizontally scalable. Given that the identity read model is scalable, this doesn't matter unless either:

a) any downtime on the ability to create and modify users is considered totally unacceptable

or

b) There is an expectation of an extremely high number of user creation and modification commands

If either of these is considered a problem, then there would need to be some logic to handle the case where conflicting events have both been written to the Event Store - e.g. two users with the same email address have been created.

####Jim.QueryHandler: Just Identity Management Query Handler

* Verifies auth tokens for other microservices.

* Also allows admins to query user details (currently all users are admins...).

####Cats: Crowdfunding Ask Templates

* Manages a collection of projects asking for crowdfunding.

* Handles both queries and commands. It can be horizontally scaled across multiple instances because there is no command that will get the system into an illegal state, even when the aggregate checked by a command handler is out of date.

####Cats.ReadModelUpdater:

* Listens to the private Cats event stream and the public identity event stream, and uses them to update SQL Server read models for use by Cats services. There can only be one running instance to avoid conflicting writes to the read models.

####Pledges:

* Allows people to make pledges to cats.

###There are also some shared libraries:

####MicroCQRS.Common

Some generic code for making F# microservices backed by EventStore and fronted by a Suave web server.

####Suave.Extensions

Some handy utilities for making Suave web services.

####MicroCQRS.Common.Testing

Some utilities for testing Suave/EventStore microservices.

###Other:
Almost all the projects have an associated unit test project. These do not require access to a real EventStore instance, and run any required web server in-process.

There is also a separate solution called IntegrationTests in its own folder, containing tests which start the services in separate processes and interact with them soley via REST. These tests verify that the different services are successfully coordinated via EventStore.
